Deploying a Django app with Apache& mod_wsgi

1. Download and install Apache 2.4 in C:/Apache24. Also download Visual C++ just in case.
   Use Apache Lounge, or any flavor you prefer.
  - After copying files over to C:/Apache24, open a CMD terminal as Administrator.
  - Navigate to C:/Apache24 and run bin\httpd.exe -k install to install the Apache service.
  - You can then navigate to localhost to view the test page.


You can start the service by running httpd.exe -k start

You can stop the services by running httpd.exe -k stop and restart it by httpd.exe -k restart

Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools. You will need this before you run pip install mod_wsgi.

Install Python 3.7 in C:/Python37 (you don't need to create a virtual environment)

Install django, openpyxl, modwsgi (see install_requirements.bat)

On a CMD terminal, run mod_wsgi-express module-config, then copy the contents and edit webproject/httpd.conf.template. Edit paths to Python and your Django project.

On a CMD terminal, run C:/Apache24/bin/httpd.exe -k start, open a web browser and navigate to localhost (make sure ALLOWED_HOSTS has been updated).
